Subject: [PATCH 2/4] arm64: dts: qcom: msm8916: Reduce reserved memory for
 venus

According to the ELF headers of the venus firmware binaries, only
~ 5 MiB (0x500000) of the venus memory region will actually end up
being used. Reduce the size of the reserved-memory region to make
slightly more RAM available for Linux.
